# Employee Attrition Prediction

# Introduction:

The project is to develop a system for project management that can effectively and efficiently manage various resources across a number of projects. 

Domains:
1. Machine learning - an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides system the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
2. Data Mining - A process used to extract usable data from a larger set of any raw data. It implies analysing data patterns in large batches of data using one or more software.
3. Web Designing - It refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development.


# Problem Formulation:

* The management of Assignment of Employees into the project according to their skillsets, area of interest and their availability is one the problem identified.Effective utilisation of Resource Management and unnecessary use of resources by the employees given by the company is also a problem.

* To map the impact of building Employee Work Profile(skillset) and effectively use it in the system for Employee growth in the industry. Employee profile is built upon the skillsets of the employees , their area of interests and previously worked projects upon. These data would be easily managed by the Project Manager for the assignment of employees into the project and for future promotion and growth of the employee. This also is an important problem which is not present currently in different softwares.

* Easy and efficient delegation to monitor each and every milestone. Tracking every milestone of the project is one of the most major problems which could not be done by the previous projects done. The employees and the project manager will update about the tasks completion on the dashboard , so that it would be easy for any person to check the status of the project and task via the dashboard.

* To check overall progress of employee and project. Report generation for mid level and high level management helps checking every user's progress report is a problem which has to be overcome in a way that Reports are easy for the Admin and Project to check the status of the project and to take actions on what to be done and what not and they can easily view the status via the dashboard.

# Scope

* The project will be an employee and project management system that will automate the tasks of employee assignment and appraisal based upon the task completed by the employees and how successfully the project managers manage the project. Promotions and appraisals can be easily looked upon by this method and can make a way for the employees and project managers to excel in their work. 

* The employee tracking will be across different projects past and future along with a profile highlighting the skills the employee possesses and also it shows the area of interest of the employees. It will also improve coordination among different departments of the organization. The manager can view the progress of their assigned projects via the dashboard. They can overlook one or more than one project. Project managers assign tasks to the employees. 
* A dashboard will show a detailed report of the current progress of the various ongoing projects with the feature showing how much work has been done by the employees and the progress of the current project. These reports can be generated to be shown to higher executives for better business management. 

* Deadlines for each Project is set by the Admin and project status and work is checked by the Project Managers and the Deadlines are given to the Employees by the Project Manager and Admin gives the Deadline for the project to the Project Managers. These deadlines can  be easily checked by any of the users on the Dashboard of Project Management System. When the deadlines are approaching various notifications are sent to the following user , if the deadline of an employee is approaching for the particular task then the Employee is sent a notification.


# Proposed Algorithm/Methodology 

* The responsibilities of an administrator can be reduced and the resources and the energy of the organization can be focused more on the development with the use of our project.

* Tasks like project progress management and report generation can be automated and be easily available to the authorities in form of graphs and charts so they are easier to explain. The employee tracking will be across different projects past and future along with a profile highlighting the skills the employee possesses and also it shows the area of interest of the employees. It will also improve coordination among different departments of the organization. The manager can view the progress of their assigned projects via the dashboard. They can overlook one or more than one project. Project managers assign tasks to the employees.

* Employee work profile can be used to track the employee’s work across different projects and can also be used as a measure for appraisal. The project will be an employee and project management system that will automate the tasks of employee assignment and appraisal based upon the task completed by the employees and how successfully the project managers manage the project. Promotions and appraisals can be easily looked upon by this method and can make a way for the employees and project managers to excel in their work. 

* Having a knowledge base that contains the details about different kinds of projects can be later used for better management and estimation of similar projects. Along with this data , the project managers get the data like the area of interests of the employees and their skill sets which could help the project managers to assign the employees to some project with this data and could bring excellence of work from the employees, if the assigned project is an area of interest for the particular employee. 

# Features of Proposed System

* There are basically three users 

1. Employee:- Employees are the basic unit of any project, they do all the work assigned to them and they are hired by the Admin and Project Managers according to their availability, their skill set and their area of interest and also the requirements of the project;

2. Project Managers:- These are the assigned Managers to the particular Project  which are  assigned by the admin and they are also an employee assigned to the project manager role and also checks the work done and is answerable to the Admin;

3. Admin:- Admin is the main handler of all the projects basically the CEO of the company who does almost all the work and projects and checks various status of the projects.


# Conclusion:

 This is a web application that can help organization in their project management activities. It can be used to improve the management quality of the organization and can work effectively as a stand-alone program or as a key component of an ERP system. Although as a part of a system it will lead to better results such as less time for administrative work by managers, easier and quicker access to needed information and reduced costs. The benefits of using a planning tool can be easily observed and measured. Having a well-thought, solid and working plan will undoubtedly lead to more well-completed projects and increasing of the business profits.
